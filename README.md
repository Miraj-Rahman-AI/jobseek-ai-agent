# JobSeek AI Agent
### Autonomous Agentic AI System for AI Engineer Job Discovery

JobSeek AI Agent is an **Agentic AI-powered automation system** that autonomously searches, collects, filters, and structures **AI Engineer campus recruitment and internship job postings** from multiple recruitment platforms. Unlike traditional web crawlers, this system uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** combined with **tool orchestration and autonomous planning** to perform complex job discovery workflows. The agent can dynamically generate search queries, scrape job listings, analyze job descriptions, extract relevant technical skills, and output structured job datasets. This project demonstrates how **Agentic AI systems can automate real-world information gathering tasks**, showcasing capabilities such as autonomous task planning, tool usage, semantic reasoning, and iterative search optimization.


# Project Motivation
Searching for AI Engineer job opportunities across multiple platforms is time-consuming and inefficient. Each recruitment website presents job information differently, requiring manual filtering and comparison. The goal of this project is to build an **intelligent AI agent that automates the entire job search pipeline**, allowing users to automatically collect and organize AI-related job opportunities.

JobSeek AI Agent can automatically:
- Search multiple recruitment websites
- Discover AI-related job postings
- Extract key job information
- Filter relevant AI Engineer roles
- Remove duplicate job listings
- Generate structured job datasets
This project demonstrates the potential of **Agentic AI architectures in real-world automation scenarios**.


# Key Features
## Autonomous Task Planning

The agent begins by interpreting the user goal and decomposing it into smaller executable tasks.

Example user goal: ```Find 50 AI Engineer campus recruitment jobs```


The agent automatically plans the workflow: ```Search → Scrape → Parse → Filter → Deduplicate → Export```

This planning capability allows the agent to operate autonomously without manual intervention.


## Multi-Platform Job Discovery

The agent collects job postings from **multiple recruitment platforms** such as:

- LinkedIn
- Indeed
- Lagou
- Zhipin
- Liepin
- Company career websites

If one platform fails or returns insufficient results, the agent automatically switches to another source.


## Iterative Search Strategy

If the collected job postings are fewer than the required number, the agent dynamically expands its search queries.

Example query expansion strategy:
- AI Engineer
- Machine Learning Engineer
- Algorithm Engineer
- LLM Engineer
- Deep Learning Engineer
- Data Scientist

This iterative process ensures the agent eventually gathers the required number of job postings.


## LLM-Based Semantic Job Filtering

The system uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to determine whether a job posting truly belongs to the AI engineering domain. The classifier analyzes job descriptions and identifies relevant technical domains such as:
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Large Language Models
- Data Science

This prevents the agent from collecting unrelated roles such as backend engineering or general software development positions.

## Automatic Technical Skill Extraction
The agent extracts **technical skill tags** from job descriptions using semantic analysis.
Example extracted skills include:
- Python
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- Transformers
- NLP
- Computer Vision
- Recommendation Systems
These tags help create structured technical skill profiles for each job posting.

## Data Cleaning and Deduplication
The system automatically cleans and standardizes collected job data by performing:
- Duplicate job detection
- Missing data handling
- Field normalization
- Structured formatting
This ensures that the final dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

## Structured Output Generation
The final job dataset is exported in structured formats:
- JSON
- CSV

Example output format:

```json
{
"title": "AI Engineer",
"company": "Example Tech",
"location": "Beijing",
"salary": "20K-35K",
"tech_tags": ["Python", "PyTorch", "NLP"],
"requirements": "Experience with machine learning and deep learning frameworks",
"source": "LinkedIn",
"job_url": "https://example.com/job"
}
```

## System Architecture
JobSeek AI Agent follows an Agentic AI workflow architecture, where an intelligent agent coordinates multiple tools and reasoning modules.
